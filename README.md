# Dynamic Element Creator

This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript to dynamically create HTML elements and add them to the page.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following:

- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript.

## Usage

The `index.html` file contains a simple HTML structure with a container div. The JavaScript code in `script.js` dynamically creates and adds elements to this container.

When you open the `index.html` file in your web browser, you will see:

- 13 h2 elements added to the "yellow" div.
- 20 h2 elements added to the "red" div.
- 33 h2 elements added to the "dark" div.
- 100 h2 elements added to the "black" div.

Additionally, the "img" div will display an image from the "img.jpg" file.

You can customize the number of h2 elements and the image by modifying the `createHTMLElement` function in the `script.js` file.
